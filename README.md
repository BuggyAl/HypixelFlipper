# HypixelFlipper [0.1.0]
Welcome to the HypixelHlipper repository! This is the source code for an auction flipper on Hypixel Skyblock. 

### Current Development - v1.0.0
The project is currently being developed and will be released at some point in the future. I may implement it into a mod at some point but it will remain as a Java project for now.
I plan to release with the following features:
- Base item flipper (calculates best items to flip)
- Complete item value calculations (reforges, enchants, gemstones, etc.)
- Lots of customizability (max price, min profit, min listings, etc.)
